<h2>SSR -> Server Side Rendering</h2>
<div class="ssr">
<p>Server-side rendering (SSR) is an applicationâ€™s ability to convert HTML files on the server into a fully rendered HTML page for the client. The web browser submits a request for information from the server, which instantly responds by sending a fully rendered page to the client.</p>

<p>To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express: <code>app.use(express.static('public'))</code></p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <li>A server-side rendered application enables pages to load faster, improving the user experience.</li>
    <li>Rendering server-side helps efficiently load webpages for users with slow internet connection or outdated devices.</li>
    <li>Webpages are correctly indexed because web browsers prioritize web pages with faster load times.</li>
    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <li>While rendering static HTML server-side is efficient, rendering bigger, more complex applications server-side can increase load times due to the bottleneck.</li>
    <li>Rendering server-side may be ideal for static site generation, but frequent server requests and full page reloads can result in overall slower page rendering in more complex applications. </li>
